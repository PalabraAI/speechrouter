Realtime ASR at $0.002/min, with live translation available on the same socket.

All prices are the vendor's public list price — 0% markup. Extra provider
knobs pass through untouched via `provider_params`.

| Model | Modes | List price | Diarization | Word timings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `palabra/asr-v1` | streaming | $0.002/min | <span class="sr-no">—</span> | <span class="sr-no">—</span> |

## Provider options

Reach past the unified surface with [`provider_params`](/guides/streaming/#query-parameters)
— forwarded streaming → URL query params. Typed in the SDKs as
`{provider}Params` interfaces (`providerParams` option / `provider_params=` kwarg).

:::note
Palabra's STT endpoint takes all configuration as query parameters; there is no config frame. token, format, sample_rate and language are set by the gateway, so restating them here has no effect. translate_languages turns on live translation: the translated frames arrive as ordinary transcripts tagged with the target language in `lang`.
:::

| Param | Type | Default | Applies to | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `translate_languages` | string | — | streaming | Comma-separated target languages (e.g. es,de,fr); translations arrive as transcripts tagged by `lang` |
| `enable_filler_filter` | boolean | `true` | streaming | Strip filler words; on by default for every language except ja |
